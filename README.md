# Find and rate the public drinking fountains

This project (for personal use) aims to create an Android app to help you find fresh water on hot summer days. It also features a review mechanism that allows users to upload pictures of fountains and give opinions about water flow, freshness, and taste.

## Implementation details
The project has been developed using Flutter by Google, along with Google Cloud and Firebase for the Maps API and storage space. The fountain database has been sourced from the OpenStreetMap database via API.
